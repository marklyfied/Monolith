reagent-name-celoxradine = celoxradine
reagent-desc-celoxradine = A medicine developed to help workers in industrial environments heal faster from uncommon workplace hazards. Slow but multipurpose.

reagent-name-rhymatine = rhymatine
reagent-desc-rhymatine = An unusual chemical for treating cellular damage, trading cellular damage for cold and shock damage.

reagent-name-mesotaxinide = mesotaxinide
reagent-desc-mesotaxinide = A refined chemical from Ambuzol+ capable of healing large amounts of toxin damage easily. It can dissolve Latoferol-based lifeforms easily. Capable of reverting natural Letoferol mutations.

reagent-name-mesophenerol = mesophenerol
reagent-desc-mesophenerol = A cheaper alternative to mesotaxinide that only reverts a natural chimera infection, and purges a system of Letoferol.

reagent-name-letoferol = Letoferol
reagent-desc-letoferol = A highly illegal bioweapon developed as a refined form of Romerol. Turns the user into more than just a mindless zombie. The usage of this is considered a violation of humanoid rights everywhere.

reagent-name-nat-letoferol = natural Letoferol
reagent-desc-nat-letoferol = A version of letoferol produced by organic means. Its much more refined, and its effects are permanent, however it takes more to convert someone.

reagent-name-protoletoferol = protoletoferol
reagent-desc-protoletoferol = Letoferol neutralized via electrolysis. Used as a precursor for the chemicals to cure it. Its too dead to do anything to you now.
